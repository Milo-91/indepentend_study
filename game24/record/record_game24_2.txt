Based on the evaluations, it seems that the numbers 10 and 14 can reach 24, while the other numbers either cannot or are unlikely to reach 24. Therefore, the correct answer is (a) 10 + 14 = 24. The explanation for this solution is provided in the text. However, since there are multiple ways to obtain 24 from the given numbers, it may also be possible to use other combinations of the given numbers to reach 24. It's up to the student to decide which combination they prefer based on their understanding of the concept. As for the remaining questions, (b) cannot be determined from the given information; (c) is likely impossible since the numbers are too small and do not add up to 24; and (d) is also likely impossible since the numbers are too small and do not multiply up to 24. Therefore, the correct answers for questions (b), (c), and (d) are (b) unknown, (c) unlikely, and (d) unlikely, respectively. The explanations for these solutions are based on the evaluations of the given numbers' ability to reach 24 using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Since the text only provides information on addition, subtraction, and division, we cannot determine the answers to questions (b), (c), and (d) with certainty. Therefore, the student should use their understanding of the concept and the given numbers to make an informed decision about the best answer for each question. If they are unsure, they may want to review the relevant concepts or seek additional help from a teacher or tutor. The key takeaway is that the text provides a method for determining if a set of numbers can reach 24 using addition, subtraction, and division, but it does not provide information on other operations or on combinations of numbers that may be necessary to reach 24. Therefore, the student should use their understanding of the concept and the given numbers to make informed decisions about the best answers for each question. If they are unsure, they may want to review the relevant concepts or seek additional help from a teacher or tutor.

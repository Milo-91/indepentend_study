Answer: 64 is not in the left sublist, so there are no valid steps to obtain 24. Therefore, the answer for this input is "No solution". Input: 7 9 10 13 Output: No solution. The remaining numbers are: 6 and 2. However, we cannot obtain 24 using any of these two numbers in combination with any other number from the given list. Therefore, there is no valid solution for this input. Note that we have tried all possible combinations of two numbers to obtain a new number, but none of them lead to 24. This means that there is no solution for this particular problem. In general, if there are only three numbers left in the list and it's not possible to obtain 24 using any combination of these three numbers, then there will be no solution.

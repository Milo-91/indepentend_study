3. What is the sum of the integers in the range 1 to 24?
First, we need to find the sum of the integers from 1 to 24. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find this sum. The formula is:

Sum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2

where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. In this case, n = 24, a1 = 1, and an = 24.

Sum = (24 * (1 + 24)) / 2
Sum = (24 * 25) / 2
Sum = 600 / 2
Sum = 300

So, the sum of the integers in the range 1 to 24 is

14 * 1 = 14 (left: 14)
14 - 1 = 13 (left: 13)
13 - 1 = 12 (left: 12)
12 * 1 = 12 (left: 12)
12 - 11 = 1 (left: 1)
1 * 1 = 1 (left: 1)
1 - 1 = 0 (left: 0)

The answer is: 0.

The answer is: 24.

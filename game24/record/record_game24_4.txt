6 + 6 = 12 (left: 12 6 6)
6 - 6 = 0 (left: 0)
6 * 6 = 36 (left: 36)
12 / 6 = 2 (left: 2 4 6)
6 + 2 = 8 (left: 8 6 6)


12 + 6 + 6 = 19
(6 - 12) * 6 = 0 * 6 = 0
I cannot obtain 24 now, but the numbers are within a reasonable range
and there are three numbers (12 6 and 6)
likely


0 is not a number, and it's impossible


36 is too big and not equal to 24
impossible


2 + 4 + 6 = 12
(6 - 2) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8
I cannot obtain 24 now, but the numbers are within a reasonable range
and there are three numbers (2 4 and 6)
likely


8 + 6 + 6 = 19
(6 - 5) * 6 = 1 * 6 = 6
I cannot obtain 24 now, but the numbers are within a reasonable range
and there are three numbers (8 6 and 6)
likely

6 / 2 = 3 (left: 3 9 12)

18 + 6 = 24, but 18 and 6 are not two numbers that can be combined to make 24.
impossible


3 + 9 + 12 = 24
sure


4 + 8 + 12 = 34
(8 - 4) * 12 = 4 * 12 = 48
I cannot obtain 24 now, but the numbers are within a reasonable range
and there are three numbers (4 8 and 12)
likely


6 + 12 + 18 = 36
(18 - 6) \* 12 = 9 * 12 = 108
6 12 and 18 are all too big
impossible


18 + 12 = 30
sure


2 + 4 + 6 = 12
(2 - 6) * 4 = -2 * 4 = -8
impossible


2 + 4 = 6
(2 - 1) * 2 = 1 \* 2 = 2
sure


4 + 4 + 2 = 8
(2 - 4) * 4 = 6
the numbers are too small, it would be impossible for them to reach 24
impossible


2 + 8 = 10
4 * 2 - 4 = 8 - 4 = 4
and there are three numbers (4 8 and 2)
sure


8 + 4 + 2 = 14 + 2 = 16
(8 - 4) \* 2 = 8 \* 2 = 16
and there are two numbers (8 and 4)
sure


6 + 14 = 20
(14 - 6) * 6 = 8 * 6 = 48
I cannot obtain 24 now, but the numbers are within a reasonable range
and there are two numbers (6 and 14)
sure


3 + 6 = 9
3 * 6 = 18
impossible


6 + 6 = 12
6 \* 6 = 36
6 are too small and do not reach 24
impossible
